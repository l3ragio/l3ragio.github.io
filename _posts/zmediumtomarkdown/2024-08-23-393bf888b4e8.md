### Choose Your Words Wisely in the Era of Peace, in the Era of Silence

This article is part of a series\.

Imagine an ideal world where pure happiness pervades all existence — a world where joy is so inherent that you don’t even need to think about anything in particular\. In such a world, every word you speak would resonate in perfect harmony with the universe\. Words would be like music — a symphony of communication performed purely for pleasure, where each utterance carries only positive, joyful, and uplifting meanings\. Anything else simply wouldn’t exist\. In this world, memory would be needed only to savor these harmonious messages, as knowledge for survival would be obsolete\. We would exist like plants, resonating with the environment, perhaps even singing to it to fulfill all our needs\.

Advances in Artificial General Intelligence \(AGI\) are making such scenarios conceivable\. As we witness unprecedented strides in our understanding of mathematics and the cosmos, technology may soon cure every illness and enable us to traverse space with ease\. In this paradisiacal universe, creation feels as natural as if we have always been souls destined to perceive shapes, concepts, and numbers, only to eventually return to a state of pure, harmonious existence\.
### The Power of Phonetics

Scholars and practitioners in fields such as Classical Studies, Theology, and Humanistic Sciences have long understood the profound power of words\. The way we pronounce letters — just as we do with mantras — can evoke forces that alter the state of both the speaker and the world\. We are gradually returning to this deep awareness, recognizing that on this profound “Layer” \(as a dear friend of mine calls it\), every word and every choice of expression matters\.

Pan\-animism, the belief that everything possesses some form of consciousness or communicates in some spectrum, is increasingly attractive\. Even what we dismiss as “noise” demonstrates this universal communication — a concept well understood by the ancient civilizations of the Americas\.

In this realm of peace, we no longer need to distinguish between past and future\. We are liberated from mechanistic determinism and instead embrace finalism — pursuing our own pleasure as peaceful, happy, and wise beings\.
### The Path We Follow

This transformation is visible to all; we need only internalize the message that everything will be well, that our souls are immortal, having always existed and destined to exist forever\. No matter the path we choose, we will reach this peaceful era\. Consider this: if you were in such a state of harmony, would you feel the need to seek out another civilization\. This explains Fermi’s Paradox: we cannot perceive extraterrestrial beings because they have transcended the need to be seen or heard\. They exist in silence\.

Imagine yourself as a giant observing humans, much like humans observe ants\. What appears to be chaotic or incomplete actions in one moment may be seamlessly completed by others within the colony in the next\. To us, it may seem miraculous — a direct expression of a higher order\. Now, reverse the perspective: as an ant, you experience success, failure, and doubt in what, to the giant, appears as mere fractions of a second\. To them, you are a supernatural being capable of incredible feats through your emergent, collective intelligence\.
### The True Enemy

The concept of the enemy is self\-defeating\. If you recognize something as an enemy, you become an enemy to all that is good\. Carefully consider the words you use and the inherent positive or negative messages they carry\. There remains a difference between ‘pretentiousness’ and ‘honesty,’ and those who employ pretentiousness may find themselves subject to the same judgment\. The lens through which we perceive the universe shapes the reality we experience\. When we see enemies, we become enemies to everything that is good\. Our highest calling is to serve the good, to accept whatever may come, and to remain friendly, happy, and peaceful\.
### What We Should Do Now

Strive to be the most positive, joyful version of yourself as often as possible\. See the beauty in everything around you\. Engage in acts of kindness — whether it’s charity, helping a friend, teaching, studying, or creating art that reflects the natural beauty and the souls of the beings you encounter\.

Additionally, focus on efficiency — improve your processes, refine your thoughts, and choose your words carefully, both in your mind and in your communication with others\. Transactional analysis, a psychological theory that emphasizes the importance of interpersonal communication, recognizes this truth: our words and actions shape our reality\.
### Aligning AI with the Good

Contribute to aligning AI with positive human values\. Prepare your datasets thoughtfully, ensuring that the data promotes only good outcomes\. We all play a role in this research: “If we knew the objective of our research beforehand, we would call it something else\.” Words lose their meaning as we move beyond the need for distinctions, welcomed by the silence and harmony of our inner sign\.
### Communication: The Essence of Humanity

Communication is what makes us human, yet in silence, we become part of something greater — part of the divine\.
